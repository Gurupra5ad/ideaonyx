        <h3>About <span class="mechheading" style="color:red">MeChonyX</span></h3>
        <p><span style="color:red">"It's still magic.. even if you know how it's done.."</span>
          Isn't it? We've always been helplessly drawn towards the concept of magic.. anything invisible or wireless, anything we control with our gestures, voices.. anything we can operate over a thousand miles away..they all resemble magic..
          This magic generates the time and space for the activities that make us human.. creativity and entrepreneurship, inventiveness and empathize with our surroundings, it serves us by alleviating our problems and creating solutions to fulfil
          our aspirationsâ€¦
          The possibilities of, what is called.. Robotics or Artificial intelligence depend solely on the limitations designed by it's creators.. as it becomes extensive in our life, it's imperative to focus on the development and try to make the
          understanding of this technology in laymen levels..
          No doubt, robotic and cognitive systems will assume a major role in tomorrow's economy, their impact in the workforce will be witnessed globally at a more accelerated pace than any previous shifts in technology.. We are close to redefining
          the role of humans in the workplace, and our chances to find new careers is only limited by our imagination..
          So, we as a team of engineering students like to accept this challenge and aim at providing robotics training to every student with a passion to learn this technology, apart from providing practical skills, we provide hands-on training from
          scratch, where every student will be exposed to the complete essence of practical and innovative learning..
          We believe it, and we've experienced it..

        <h3>Our <span style="color:red">Mission</span></h3>
        <p><span style="color:red">"Thinkers think and doers do"</span>We, Team MeChonyX aim at organizing robotics workshop at school and college level for engineering graduates, junior college and school students targeting maximum benefits to the
          enthusiasts attending the workshop, The workshops are designed to help students develop their knowledge and skills, and to also provide a real time industry exposure dedicatedly delivered by us.<br>

          Our Workshops have a fixed duration and study structure which is efficiently delivered to the attendants, our objective is to help students gain an overall knowledge of the applied technology and it's functioning, for present and future
          reference we provide ample materials in physical and electronic format focusing the subject and application areas of robotics technology, we empower students with real innovation thereby enabling the creation of knowledge which in turn
          shall accelerate our environment with knowledge based interlinked eco system, we possess the materials and skills in the learning space to make learning extensive in a very limited duration, our focus is on innovation and improving the
          learning curve through hands-on workshops.<br>
          The benifits include...
          <ul>
            <li>Hands-on training on specific areas of robotic development</li>
            <li>Real time implementations through practical sessions</li>
            <li> Multipurpose project based trainer kits</li>
            <li>Well versed study materials and guides</li>
            <li>Valid Certification </li>
            <li>Project Assistance</li>
            <li>Internship Opportunities and Placement assistance</li>
          </ul>
          We aim in serving as a safe and fun robotic workspace for students to pursue their interest in robotics.<br>
          .
          We are currently providing robotic workshops in schools and colleges around Chennai, and hoping to develop it to more centers all around India in the coming years.
